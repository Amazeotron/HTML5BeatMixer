# HTML5 BeatMixer
HTML5 BeatMixer is an HTML5 webkitAudioContext and Canvas experiment. It's just a basic bet mixer with controls to start / stop playback, and change the playback speed. I'm planning on adding features as I go (like loading sound collections). 

I built this as a way to learn the webkitAudioContext API, so don't expect anything amazing here. Maybe if you're learning, you can get something out of my code.

Right now, the code isn't very well commented. I'll be adding that soon.
